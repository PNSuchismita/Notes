    "\n",
    "Recursion is an approach to a problem solving where the solution depends partially on solutions to smaller instances of related problems.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A recursive functions consists of **base cases** and **calls to the same function** with different arguments. Two key ingredients to a successful use of recursion are: \n",
    "* Identifying the base cases, which are to be solved directly.\n",
    "* Ensuring progress, that is the recursion converges to the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Divide-and-conquer is not synonymous with recursion. In divide-and-conquer, the problem is divided into two or more independent smaller problems that are of the same type as the original problem. Recursion is more general - there may be a single subproblem, and the subproblems may not be of the same type as the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursion Boot Camp\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.  \n",
    "**Solution**: The central idea is that if $y > x$, the GCD of $x$ and $y$ is the GCD of $x$ and $y-x$. By extension, this implies that the GCD of $x$ and $y$ is the GCD of $x$ and $y$ mod $x$, i.e., GCD(156, 36) = GCD((156 mod 36)=12, 36) = GCD(12, (36 mod 12)=0) = 12"

    "* Recursion is especially suitable when the **input is expressed using recursive rules** such as a computer grammar.\n",
    "* Recursion is a good choice for **search, enumeration**, and **divide-and-conquer**.\n",
    "* Use recursion as **alternative to deeply nested iteration** loops. For example, recursion is much better when you have an undefined number of levels, such as the IP address problem generalized to k substrings.\n",
    "* If you are asked to **remove recursion** from a program, consider mimicking call stack with the **stack data structure**.\n",
    "* Recursion can be easily removed from a **tail-recursive** program by using a while loop - no stack is needed. (Optimizing compilers do this.)\n",
    "* If a recursive function may end up being called with the **same arguments** more tha nonce, **cache** the results - this is the idea behind Dynamic Programming."
