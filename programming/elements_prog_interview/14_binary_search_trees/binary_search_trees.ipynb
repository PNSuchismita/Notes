    "The keys stored at nodes of Binary Search Tree (BST) have to respect a BST property - the key stored at a node is greater than or equal to the keys stored at the nodes of its left subtree and less than or equal to the keys stored in the nodes of its right subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Key lookup, insertion, and deletion take time proportional to the height of the tree, which can in worst-case be $O(n)$.\n",
    "* There are implementations of insert and delete which guarantee that the tree has height $O(\\log{n})$. \n",
    "    * These require storing and updating additional data at the tree nodes. \n",
    "    * Red-black trees are an example of height-balanced BSTs.\n",
    "* As a rule, **avoid putting mutable objects in a BST**. Otherwise, when a mutable object that's in a BST is to be updated, always first remove it from the tree, then update it, then add it back."
