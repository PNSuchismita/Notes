    "### 2. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary?\n",
    "\n",
    "From Quora: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-list-and-a-dictionary-in-Python\n",
    "* **List** is the most versatile mutable Sequence available in Python, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values between square brackets.\n",
    "    * Elements present in List maintain their order unless explicitly re-ordered .\n",
    "    * Elements are accessed through their numeric (zero based) index values.\n",
    "    * If you have a collection of data that does not need random access, use List.\n",
    "    * Where you have to deal with values which can be changed, use List.\n",
    "* **Dictionary** is an unordered mutable collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are used to handle large amount of data.\n",
    "    * Every entry is a key-value pair.\n",
    "    * Elements are accessed using key values.\n",
    "    * When you are dealing with unique keys and you are mapping values to the keys, use Dictionary.\n",
    "                   \n",
    "### 3. In a list, what data types can be elements?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The elements present in list can be of any type (float, string, tuple, list, etc.), and types can be mixed.\n",
    "       \n",
    "### 4. In a dictionary, what data types can the key be? And the values? Why?\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Key values can be of any hashable type (i.e. not a dict), which includes: strings, numbers, and tuples. Types can be mixed.\n",
    "    * For example, lists can't be keys because they are not hashable and looking up different lists with the same contents would produce different results, even though comparing lists with the same contents would indicate them as equivalent.\n",
    "* Values can be of any type (including other dict’s), and types can be mixed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 5. When would you use a list vs. a tuple vs. a set in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **sets** if you have hashable items, don't care either way about order or duplicates, and want speedy membership checking.\n",
    "* Use **lists** when you have non-hashable items, care about the order or duplicates, and want to change the items (mutate).\n",
    "* Use **tuples** if you're defining a constant set of values (don't need to change the values later) and all you're ever going to do with it is iterate through it (tuples are faster than lists).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 6. Explain the difference between a for loop and a while loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **While** loop is used in situations where we do not know how many times loop needs to be excuted beforehand.\n",
    "    * In while loop, condition is checked first, if the given condition is true, then the control will enter the body of the loop.\n",
    "* **For** loop is used where we already know about the number of times loop needs to be excuted. Typically for a index used in iteration.\n",
    "    * In the For loop you MUST create a new variable, thats not true for the While loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What packages in the standard library, useful for Data Science work, do you know?\n",
    "\n",
    "* In standard library. From Python3 documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html\n",

    "            * timedelta.min, timedelta.max, timedelta.total_seconds(), mathematical operations with timedeltas, etc..\n",
    "        * **date Objects**. A date object represents a date (year, month and day) in an idealized calendar, the current Gregorian calendar indefinitely extended in both directions.\n",
    "            * class datetime.date(year, month, day)\n",
    "            * date.min, date.max, date.year, date.month, date.day, date.replace(year=self.year, month=self.month, day=self.day), date.weekday(), date.strftime(format), etc.\n",
    "        * **datetime Objects**. A datetime object is a single object containing all the information from a date object and a time object.\n",
    "            * class datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0, tzinfo=None, *, fold=0)\n",

    "    6. **glob — Unix style pathname pattern expansion**. The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in arbitrary order.\n",
    "        * glob.glob(pathname, *, recursive=False), glob.iglob(pathname, *, recursive=False), glob.escape(pathname) - Escape all special characters ('?', '*' and '[')\n",
    "    7. **statistics — Mathematical statistics functions**. This module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric (Real-valued) data.\n",
    "        * These functions calculate an average ortypical value from a population or sample.\n",

    "* Not in standard library. From https://www.upwork.com/hiring/data/15-python-libraries-data-science/\n",
    "    1. **NumPy** is the foundational library for scientific computing in Python. NumPy introduces objects for multidimensional arrays and matrices, as well as routines that allow developers to perform advanced mathematical and statistical functions on those arrays with as little code as possible.\n",
    "    2. **SciPy** builds on NumPy by adding a collection of algorithms and high-level commands for manipulating and visualizing data. This package includes functions for computing integrals numerically, solving differential equations, optimization, and more.\n",
    "    3. **Pandas** adds data structures and tools that are designed for practical data analysis in finance, statistics, social sciences, and engineering. Pandas works well with incomplete, messy, and unlabeled data (i.e., the kind of data you’re likely to encounter in the real world), and provides tools for shaping, merging, reshaping, and slicing datasets.\n",
    "    4. **matplotlib** is the standard Python library for creating 2D plots and graphs. It’s pretty low-level, meaning it requires more commands to generate nice-looking graphs and figures than with some more advanced libraries. However, the flip side of that is flexibility. With enough commands, you can make just about any kind of graph you want with matplotlib.\n",
    "    5. **scikit-learn** builds on NumPy and SciPy by adding a set of algorithms for common machine learning and data mining tasks, including clustering, regression, and classification. As a library, scikit-learn has a lot going for it. Its tools are well-documented and its contributors include many machine learning experts. What’s more, it’s a very curated library, meaning developers won’t have to choose between different versions of the same algorithm. Its power and ease of use make it popular with a lot of data-heavy startups, including Evernote, OKCupid, Spotify, and Birchbox.\n",
    "    6. **TensorFlow** is another high-profile entrant into machine learning, developed by Google as an open-source successor to DistBelief, their previous framework for training neural networks. TensorFlow uses a system of multi-layered nodes that allow you to quickly set up, train, and deploy artificial neural networks with large datasets. It’s what allows Google to identify objects in photos or understand spoken words in its voice-recognition app.\n",
    "    7. **Seaborn** is a popular visualization library that builds on matplotlib’s foundation. The first thing you’ll notice about Seaborn is that its default styles are much more sophisticated than matplotlib’s. Beyond that, Seaborn is a higher-level library, meaning it’s easier to generate certain kinds of plots, including heat maps, time series, and violin plots.\n",

The type is specified at object creation time by using a type code, which is a single character. The type codes can be found in the documentation.\n",
