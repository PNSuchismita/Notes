    "### Simple Forecasting Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Average Method**: Assumes the best predictor of what will happen tomorrow is the average of everything that has happened up until now.\n",
    "* **Moving Average Method**: This method uses the average of a time series over defined number of time periods.\n",
    "* **Naive Method**: All forecasts are simply set to be equal to the las observation.\n",
    "* **Seasonal Naive Method**: Assumes that the magnitude of the seasonal pattern will will remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trend\n",
    "\n",
    "In time series analysis a **trend** is a gradual shift or moviement to relatively higher or lower values over long period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Uptrend**: When a trend pattern exhibits a general direction that is upward where there are higher highs and higher lows.\n",
    "* **Downtrend**: When a trend pattern exhibits a general direction that is down where there are lower highs and lower lows.\n",
    "* **Horizontal or Stationary Trend**: When there is no trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series that exhibits a repeating pattern **at fixed intervals** of time within a one year period is said to have a seasonal pattern or seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cyclical Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "A cyclical pattern exists when the data exhibits rises an falls that are **not of a fixed period**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In finance\n",
    "* **Bull Market**: Cyclical uptrend\n",
    "* **Bear Market**: Ciclical downtrend"
