    "### Simple Forecasting Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Average Method**: Assumes the best predictor of what will happen tomorrow is the average of everything that has happened up until now.\n",
    "* **Moving Average Method**: This method uses the average of a time series over defined number of time periods.\n",
    "* **Naive Method**: All forecasts are simply set to be equal to the las observation.\n",
    "* **Seasonal Naive Method**: Assumes that the magnitude of the seasonal pattern will will remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trend\n",
    "\n",
    "In time series analysis a **trend** is a gradual shift or moviement to relatively higher or lower values over long period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Uptrend**: When a trend pattern exhibits a general direction that is upward where there are higher highs and higher lows.\n",
    "* **Downtrend**: When a trend pattern exhibits a general direction that is down where there are lower highs and lower lows.\n",
    "* **Horizontal or Stationary Trend**: When there is no trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series that exhibits a repeating pattern **at fixed intervals** of time within a one year period is said to have a seasonal pattern or seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cyclical Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "A cyclical pattern exists when the data exhibits rises an falls that are **not of a fixed period**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In finance  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bull Market**: Cyclical uptrend\n",
    "* **Bear Market**: Ciclical downtrend"

    "### Exponential Smoothing Models\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exponential Smoothing forecasts use weighed averages of past observations giving more weight to the most recent observations with weights gradually getting smaller as the observation gets older.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ETS** represents how Error, Trend, and Seasonality are applied in the smoothing method calculation. Each term can be applied either additively, multiplicatively, or in some cases be left out of the model all together. "
